## Role Definition & Evolution

**ML Engineers** are technical specialists responsible for developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models in production. Unlike data scientists—who focus on research, exploration, and experimentation—ML Engineers own the full machine learning lifecycle: from data pipelines and model training to deployment, monitoring, and iteration.

The role has evolved significantly from its origins in academic research to require strong software engineering, deep learning, and data architecture skills, reflecting the complexity of real-world AI systems. Modern ML Engineers must balance model performance with system reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
