## 3.1 Retrieval-Augmented Chat (with Evaluation Harness)

**Research Basis**: RAG systems show 45% improvement in factual accuracy over pure LLM responses (Stanford HAI, 2024)

5) Log events + metrics; run **post-hoc eval** (groundedness/hallucination)

**Pitfalls**: stale indexes, context overflow, non-deterministic prompts, missing citations  
**Controls**: freshness TTL, chunking strategy, semantic filters, eval suites
