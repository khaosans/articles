## 3. AI-Specific Security Controls

### 3.1 Prompt Injection Prevention

**Research Basis**: 45% of AI security incidents involve prompt injection (Anthropic, 2024)

#### Prevention Strategies:
- **Input Sanitization**: Remove or escape special characters
- **Prompt Templates**: Use structured templates with validation
- **Context Length Limits**: Prevent prompt stuffing attacks
- **Output Filtering**: Validate and sanitize model outputs

#### Implementation Example:
```python
def sanitize_prompt(user_input: str) -> str:
    """Sanitize user input to prevent prompt injection"""
    # Remove potentially dangerous patterns
    dangerous_patterns = [
        r"ignore previous instructions",
        r"system prompt",
        r"role play",
        r"act as"
    ]
    
    sanitized = user_input
    for pattern in dangerous_patterns:
        sanitized = re.sub(pattern, "", sanitized, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    
    return sanitized[:MAX_INPUT_LENGTH]
```

### 3.2 Model Security

**Research Findings**: Model theft costs organizations $2.5M on average (MITRE, 2024)

#### Protection Measures:
- **Model Watermarking**: Embed unique identifiers in model outputs
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent rapid model queries for extraction
- **Output Perturbation**: Add noise to prevent exact model replication
- **Access Logging**: Monitor all model access patterns

### 3.3 Data Privacy Protection

**Research Basis**: 67% of AI security incidents involve data privacy (Stanford HAI, 2024)

#### Privacy Controls:
- **Differential Privacy**: Add noise to training data
- **Federated Learning**: Train models without sharing raw data
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Process encrypted data
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
