## 2. Token Economics & LLM Cost Optimization

### 2.1 Token Cost Analysis

**Research Basis**: Token costs represent 30% of total AI spend (OpenAI, 2024; Anthropic, 2024)

#### Cost Factors:
- **Model Selection**: Different models have varying cost per token
- **Input Length**: Longer prompts cost more
- **Output Length**: Generated content adds to costs
- **Request Frequency**: High-frequency requests increase costs

#### Cost Optimization Strategies:

**1. Model Selection Optimization**
```python
# Cost comparison example
models = {
    "gpt-4": {"cost_per_1k_tokens": 0.03, "performance": "high"},
    "gpt-3.5-turbo": {"cost_per_1k_tokens": 0.002, "performance": "medium"},
    "claude-3-sonnet": {"cost_per_1k_tokens": 0.015, "performance": "high"},
    "claude-3-haiku": {"cost_per_1k_tokens": 0.00025, "performance": "medium"}
}

def select_optimal_model(use_case, budget, performance_requirement):
    """Select optimal model based on cost and performance requirements"""
    suitable_models = [
        model for model, specs in models.items()
        if specs["performance"] >= performance_requirement
    ]
    
    return min(suitable_models, key=lambda m: models[m]["cost_per_1k_tokens"])
```

**2. Prompt Optimization**
- **Prompt Engineering**: Reduce token usage through efficient prompting
- **Context Management**: Limit context length to essential information
- **Template Optimization**: Use reusable, efficient prompt templates

**3. Caching Strategies**
- **Response Caching**: Cache common responses to avoid repeated API calls
- **Embedding Caching**: Cache vector embeddings for RAG systems
- **Result Caching**: Cache model outputs for similar inputs

### 2.2 Advanced Token Optimization

**Research Findings**: Intelligent caching can reduce token costs by 50% (LangSmith, 2024)

#### Implementation Strategies:
```python
class TokenOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.token_tracker = TokenTracker()
    
    def optimize_prompt(self, prompt, max_tokens=1000):
        """Optimize prompt to reduce token usage"""
        # Remove redundant information
        optimized = self.remove_redundancy(prompt)
        
        # Truncate if necessary
        if len(optimized) > max_tokens:
            optimized = self.smart_truncate(optimized, max_tokens)
        
        return optimized
    
    def cache_response(self, prompt_hash, response):
        """Cache response for future use"""
        self.cache[prompt_hash] = {
            "response": response,
            "timestamp": time.time(),
            "usage_count": 0
        }
```

## 3. Infrastructure Cost Optimization

### 3.1 Compute Resource Optimization

**Research Basis**: Compute costs represent 35% of total AI spend (AWS, 2024; Google Cloud, 2024)

#### Optimization Strategies:

**1. Instance Type Selection**
- **Spot Instances**: Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
- **Reserved Instances**: Commit to long-term usage for discounts
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale resources based on demand

**2. Model Serving Optimization**
```python
# Model serving cost optimization
class CostOptimizedModelServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {}
        self.usage_tracker = UsageTracker()
    
    def select_optimal_deployment(self, model, expected_load):
        """Select optimal deployment strategy based on cost and performance"""
        if expected_load < 1000:  # Low load
            return "serverless"  # Pay per request
        elif expected_load < 10000:  # Medium load
            return "container"   # Fixed cost
        else:  # High load
            return "dedicated"   # Optimized for throughput
```

**3. Batch Processing**
- **Batch Inference**: Process multiple requests together
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Run heavy computations during off-peak hours
- **Resource Pooling**: Share resources across multiple models

### 3.2 Storage & Data Cost Optimization

**Research Findings**: Data storage costs can be reduced by 40% through optimization (Google Cloud, 2024)

#### Optimization Strategies:
- **Data Lifecycle Management**: Automatically move data to cheaper storage tiers
- **Compression**: Compress data to reduce storage costs
- **Data Deduplication**: Remove duplicate data
- **Selective Loading**: Load only necessary data for processing

- **Cost per Model**: Cost breakdown by model type
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cost per unit of performance

#### Monitoring Tools:
```python
class CostMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {}
        self.alerts = []
    
    def track_cost(self, service, cost, metadata):
        """Track cost for different services"""
        if service not in self.metrics:
            self.metrics[service] = []
        
        self.metrics[service].append({
            "cost": cost,
            "timestamp": time.time(),
            "metadata": metadata
        })
    
    def generate_cost_report(self):
        """Generate comprehensive cost report"""
        report = {
            "total_cost": sum(sum(m["cost"] for m in metrics) 
                            for metrics in self.metrics.values()),
            "cost_by_service": {service: sum(m["cost"] for m in metrics)
                               for service, metrics in self.metrics.items()},
            "cost_trends": self.analyze_trends(),
            "optimization_recommendations": self.generate_recommendations()
        }
        return report
```

### 4.2 Cost Alerting & Budget Management

    total_benefits = (annual_savings + revenue_impact + 
                     efficiency_gains + risk_reduction)
    
    roi = ((total_benefits - implementation_cost) / 
           implementation_cost) * 100
    
    payback_period = implementation_cost / total_benefits
    
    return {
        "roi_percentage": roi,
        "payback_period_years": payback_period,
