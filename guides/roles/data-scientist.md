## Introduction

In today's data-driven economy, Data Scientists serve as the critical link between business objectives and analytical insights. While ML Engineers focus on production systems and Data Engineers build infrastructure, Data Scientists own the analytical lifecycle—from problem definition and data exploration to model development and business impact measurement. Their work directly influences strategic decisions across every industry sector.
